##### JD D'Annunzio

Hello everyone! Welcome to my project for the first term of Code Louisville's Data Analysis course.

#### Purpose

This project is intended to analyze, visualize, and compare the traffic crash data of Louisville and Cincinnati in the prior three years, so as to include just before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Features

I have implemented the following features:

- Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type.

- Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to do things like remove 0’s and null values where they don’t belong in your dataset.

- Write custom functions to operate on your data.

- Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting.

- Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code. If you make a few plots with matplotlib, explain what the reader is seeing and why you chose to plot things that way.

#### Current Issues

- To be added
