##### JD D'Annunzio

Hello everyone! Welcome to my project for the first term of Code Louisville's Data Analysis course.

#### Purpose

This project is intended to analyze, visualize, and compare the traffic crash data of Louisville and Cincinnati in the prior three years, so as to include just before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. I chose this period because of the dramatic nationwide drop in travel (and, therefore, collisions) in March 2020 and [recent analyses](https://www.nsc.org/newsroom/nsc-analysis-traffic-is-back-to-prepandemic-levels) showing that traffic death rates are now higher than in 2019. I had difficulty finding data or analysis dealing with smaller US cities and so decided to try and make some of my own.

#### Features

I have implemented the following features:

- Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type.

- Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to do things like remove 0’s and null values where they don’t belong in your dataset.

- Write custom functions to operate on your data.

    - For clarity, the operations I perform on my data are not contained within functions, but they are not stock operations either.

- Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting.

- Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code. If you make a few plots with matplotlib, explain what the reader is seeing and why you chose to plot things that way.

#### Current Issues

- To be added
